        <h3>Battery Replacement</h3>
            <p>
                If your watch is no longer keeping time like it once was, it might be its 
                battery. Battery replacements are fairly easy and quick. Water pressure tests 
                are always conducted after a battery replacement 
                to ensure your watch has a good seal.

        <h3>Deep Cleaning</h3>
            <p>
                It's normal for watches to get scratched and dirty over time. If you feel 
                like your watch needs a little TLC, bring it in so we're able to give it
                a deep clean and buff and polish it. When you get your watch back, it'll 
                look as if you just bought it!
